![Screenshot of v1.0 of webpage](img/ToDo%20Webpage%20Screenshot%20v1.1.png)

## Overview
A simple webpage that allows the user to create, view and delete To-Dos.

## Usage
1. Clone project to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE.
3. Open the html file to use the webpage. 

## Possible Improvements

1. Currently, the user input for a task is entered via a prompt dialog box. An improvement would be to create an input element and a button element and have the user enter their ToDo via that.
2. The UI definitely needs some improvement, whether to look more inviting or be more intuitive.
3. Actually add a label to tell when a task is complete, incomplete or in-progress, rather than just deleting the task to signify it is complete.

## Disadvantages

1. To-Dos do not persist. If you refresh the browser, all To-Dos will be gone.
